## Reflection

I am a masterâ€™s student and new in the education field, so I had some concerns and questions while I was planning my lesson. Working with my group was extremely helpful because they addressed my questions and provided constructive feedback. Besides that, I also benefited from the feedback they provided to each other about their lessons.

When I decided on the topic of my lesson, I was not sure for what grade level my lesson could be appropriate. My group suggested that I should plan the lesson for any grade from 10th to 12th, which helped me develop my lesson having in mind the age of the student population.

My lesson is about the Tower of Hanoi puzzle that uses a recursive algorithm for its solution. My slides show the solution for 3 and 4 rings. My group suggested that the concept of recursion should be added to the slides. I assume that the students have already learned about recursion in a previous lesson. Adding the concept of recursion, as my group suggested, will help students recall it in case they forgot about recursion.

I prepared a starter code for the three different levels of assignments, mild, medium, and spicy. I was not sure if the code provided could be helpful enough for the students to complete their assignments. My group provided positive feedback, which made me feel more confident about the starter code.

Overall, I had a good experience working on this project with my group. They are excellent teachers, and I learned from their experience.
