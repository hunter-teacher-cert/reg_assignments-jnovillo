## Real world data assignment

For this assignment, I am assuming that students have previously installed a virtual environment for Python, worked with Python, and that I gave a lesson about using Plotly Express with pandas.

This assignment will allow students to practice filtering, grouping, and sorting data. They will also practice data representation using different charts such as treemaps, histograms, line charts, and show data on a map. Please see assignment_directions.pdf for more detailed information about the questions for this assignment.

This website https://datausa.io/profile/geo/new-york-ny provides data sets for different information about New York, NY. For this assignment, I am using the following data sets:
race and ethnicity, employment by occupations, and global diversity.
