### Task

Students will be asked to develop the game “Rock, papers, scissors, fire, water” in Python (a quick look at the FRIENDS series, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMCE2cvR7tg). The user should enter a selection that has to be a string. Please note that the user could enter a word in lowercase, uppercase, or a combination of both. The computer randomly makes a selection. Then, the winner (user vs. computer) should be determined based on the rules of the game (see image below). The program should keep and show the players’ scores. After each game, the program should ask if the user wants to play again.

**Note:** Started code is not provided because the code for the game “Rock, papers, scissors” in Python could be found online. However, students should adjust to meet all the requirements detailed in the task. For instance, I added “fire, water” to the game so students do not only copy and paste the code they find. I also include a mixed user input string (that will make the students convert the string into one format, for example, only lowercase) because this feature is not found in the results when students will search for the game “Rock, papers, scissors, fire, water” online.

This is an interesting project that uses a Raspberry Pi and a Pi Camera Module to develop a program for the game. The GitHub to access the code is here https://github.com/DrGFreeman/rps-cv. However, for this task, this code is not helpful. Students could find this information complex, and the use of external devices (Raspberry Pi and a Pi Camera Module) is unnecessarily complicated. Students could get lost trying to understand how the code works, but students could learn about the existence of these devices that could be used to create exciting projects. The code available is copy pastable.

In my opinion, this web page is the most useful to solve the task because it starts explaining the game, so if any students are unfamiliar with the game, they will learn how it works. There are also flowcharts that describe the sequence of the game. Flowcharts are a visual way to understand what the code should do. Moreover, it describes step by step the lines of code that should be written to generate the desired output, and there is a clear explanation for each line of code. It also provides the code that will permit play several games in a row. The explanation on this web page is simple, which will help students work on their task following the indications. Students can learn how working with strings as user inputs could generate some issues because of capitalization. The web page shows alternatives to avoid those issues, consisting of assigning numeric values to a string. Students could learn that and have that in mind for other projects because they have to validate the user input as a string for this task. The code available is copy pastable.

The code for this game has basic documentation, and there is no detailed explanation. It will probably be useful for medium to advanced students. Beginners could need some support to have a better understanding. This code is the only one I found that keeps a score for the game. The code available is copy pastable.

This webpage could be helpful for students to perform their task. It gives the code for a single game, breaking it down and providing detailed information. When the user enters a non-expected value, a warning message will appear. The information on this page is pretty simple to understand. The code available is copy pastable.

This webpage could be useful for students with medium and advanced skills. The code is documented, but there is not a detailed explanation which could cause beginners to get confused. This code considers integers for user input which minimize the risk of mistyping strings. However, students should work with user inputs as strings for the given task. The code available is copy pastable.
