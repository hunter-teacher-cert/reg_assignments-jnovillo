### Title
Brain Implant Allows Fully Paralyzed Patient to Communicate

### Summary

This is an excellent technology article that I would like to discuss with the students in the classroom. The following are the significant points that I would cover in the discussion:

1. In recent years, a new method known as "brain-computer interface technologies" has been developed. This technology intends to translate a person's brain signals into commands. Many companies and billionaires like Elon Musk have invested in this technology.
2. Dr. Ujwal Chaudhary (University of TÃ¼bingen and the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering in Geneva) performed an experiment on a man in a locked-in state. The patient was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This condition degenerates the brain's cells that help the human body move. He could not even move his eyeballs. For the experiment, a neurosurgeon implanted two tiny electrodes in regions of the man's brain that control the body motion, and he was trained using auditory neurofeedback, a technique by which patients are trained to manipulate their brain activity. According to the patient, he imagined "eye movement" to alter his own brain activity. With this experiment, the man learned to select letters from the stream that a computer spoke aloud with his thoughts, and he was able to select approximately one letter per minute to formulate words and sentences. 
3. However, some scientists are not totally convinced of this method, and they claimed that the study is based on only one patient and needs to be tested on many others. They suggest this study is experimental, and there is still a lot to learn.
4. The following question is not in the article but could be a topic of discussion after introducing the story: Is it the beginning of cyborgs (being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts)? It would be interesting to know what the students think about this topic. Technology is beneficial for everybody. It makes our life easier. However, students should know that it is essential to establish technology ethics and set limits to avoid harmful effects.

Point 1 would introduce the concept of the new technology that has been developed, "brain-computer interface technologies." Point 2 would help inform and discuss with the students the experiment that was performed to contribute to the new technology developed. I would like to know their points of view about this experiment. Point 3 would inform that this study is experimental and more tests and research are necessary. This would show the students that there are always ways to improve technology. Point 4 is an interesting topic for discussion.

### Why did I select this story?

I selected this story because it is fascinating how technology could be used for medical purposes. Things that seem impossible (like communicating with a paralyzed patient) can become a reality using devices and software. Also, I chose this article because I think adolescents are always curious about discoveries, and they could find this story interesting.
