## Equity Grading

According to Joe Feldman, author of *Grading for Equity* and the CEO of Crescendo Education Group, the grading system currently used is based on grading practices that are 100 years old, and he suggests that grading should be more equitable. Changing the traditional ways of grading teaching, learning, and relationships in the classroom would be better.

Overall, I agree with the general opinion of Feldman. As society evolves, the education system evolves too, and this evolution should include the ways of grading. However, finding equity in grading is difficult. In my opinion, there will always be some students who will perform better in different circumstances, and this is because we are all different. For instance, we process information differently and have different ambitions, backgrounds, and behaviors. Some students can process knowledge directly in the classroom while they listen to their teacher, while others need extra time or practice to learn. Another aspect to consider is that students who have excellent performance at school are not necessarily the ones who perform better in the professional world, which suggests that grades do not reflect the overall capabilities of the students in different environments.

Expressly, I agree with the following Feldman's suggestions:

- The level of mastery should not be measured with points. It is common to hear students talking about points (I did it during my school years, and my daughter does it now) rather than how much they know about different subjects. It would be ideal if students, instead of saying "I need two more points to have an A+," would say, "I need to know this (anything) better to have an A+." As Feldman says, "getting students to talk more in the vocabulary of the content area." In the end, what matters the most is not the grade but how much students learn and know. A grade is not a mirror of knowledge. For instance, some students really know the content, but they do not perform well in exams because of stress or nerves. However, there is something that has always worried me: grades do not consider a student's progress. If a student got a bad grade early in the trimester or semester but got to master the content at the end, the student will not be graded again. Students will carry those bad grades on their backs. The margin to make a mistake is too thin.
- Behavior should not be part of the grade. I think behavior does not have a concrete link with mastery of a particular subject. Because of that, I do not think teachers should use it to grade students. I know students should behave well, but some other rewards instead of grading should be discussed to promote motivation that leads to good behavior in class. However, bad behavior has to be notified to the school and parents. We cannot accept bad behavior in the classroom, and this has to be solved in a way different than using grades.
- Classwork and homework should not be graded because those activities support the learning process, and it is a way to prepare themselves for the summative assessments. I understand that students put effort into working on these daily tasks, but it is beneficial for them. Thus, I would not grade classwork and homework.

On the other hand, I cannot entirely agree with Feldman regarding late work. I understand that sometimes things out of the students' hands could happen. In those situations, teachers could make exceptions and do not penalize late work. Yet, it does not mean that students have the free choice to turn in their work late. I also understand that some projects could not be completed at the expected established date in the professional world. Especially in the CS field, we can estimate the duration of a project, but it often takes longer because of unexpected issues while programming. However, during childhood and adolescence, students are developing, have not reached maturity yet, and their sense of responsibility is not totally formed. If they present a work late, they would not always have a good reason for that. Maybe some of them prefer to play video games or watch TV and postpone their school work. Also, the teacher will continue to give them assignments, so students will have a significant workload if they do not turn them in on time.

I am not teaching nor have a teaching background. However, when I become a teacher, I would not emphasize so much in grades. As I said before, grades are not the only factor to consider regarding mastery. I would instead emphasize the importance of learning the content because nobody asks you how many points you got in a particular exam or project in the professional world. They ask about your knowledge and skills. I want to prepare my students to face different environments they will eventually face in their professional world.
