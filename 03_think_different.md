## Strategies for differentiation in a Computer Science class

### 1. Mild, medium, and spicy levels system
All students are assigned the same project. However, the teacher provides a starter code to the students based on their programming abilities. Students who struggle with coding (mild level) could get a starter code with detailed information that allows the students to complete the project. Students who need some support (medium) could have a starter code with general information. Students who are strong at programming (spicy) would not need a starter code. This strategy could be used for ability differentiation. Students could work independently. They would have the option to choose which level they want to start having the option to change to another level depending on how they feel with their first choice. Alternatively, the teacher could give the students a non-graded assignment to find out their spiciness level. The goal of using this strategy is to allow students to complete a task and make them feel successful, which could motivate them in class.

### 2. Differentiation by grouping
This strategy consists in having the students work in small groups (3 students per group). Students could be grouped based on their interests, such as sports, hobbies, TV shows, movies, and assigned a programming project related to their interests. When the teacher forms the groups, it should be important to do it so that at least one student with strong CS skills is in the group. Thus, this student could support the other group members, which is one of the goals of using this strategy. Another objective is to engage and motivate the students by relating the assignment with something of their interest.

### 3. Adjusting teacher’s level of involvement
Students could be grouped by learning style and/or ability level to work on a particular project. For instance, students who need support while performing a task could be together, and the teacher could spend more time with that group. In contrast, students who prefer to work independently without the teacher’s assistance could have the opportunity to do it as well. The goal of this strategy is that students who need support or struggle with the content can benefit from the presence and support of the teacher to develop their tasks.
