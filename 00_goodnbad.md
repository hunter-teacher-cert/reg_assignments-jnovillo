### About me
I am a master's student, and I have no experience teaching in a school. However, I am always trying to engage my 9 years old daughter to learn CS. I am glad she is into everything related to computers and technology. On many occasions, we have been together learning some topics about CS. From simple things like drawing to more complex things for her age using Code.org.
### Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly
A few times, I felt that teaching my daughter how to create scripts in Code.org did not go as I wanted. For instance, the first time that I tried to teach her how to move an object from one place to another, having to use loops; she was lost and did not understand how loops work. I tried to explain differently using other words, writing on a paper, and looking at examples. She continued to say, "It is hard, I do not understand, I do not want to do it." This situation was really frustrating for me.
##### Why do you think it didn't go well?
I think teaching loops to my daughter did not go well for a few possible reasons (not sure which one of them), such as I did not explain it using an appropriate language for her, or if she was tired and did not want to learn at that moment or if she really had trouble understanding the new concept. 
##### What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
Before teaching loops to my daughter, we worked on some other little scripts, and she successfully did all of them. Her scripts did what they were supposed to do, and she was so excited. However, when we encountered these new activities requiring loops, her first tries did not work, and she felt frustrated. One thing that could have made this experience better is to explain the new concept "loops" at the beginning when she was not tired, and she was not used to all her exercises being successful.

### Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well
On one occasion, I had to teach an intern at my work the benefits of using a database to store data and manage it using SQL. He did not have any previous experience with SQL, so I had to teach him the most important commands to create a database, add users and assign them permissions, insert, update, select and delete data. We use big data sets at my work, so it is essential to improve query performance. For that, I explained how indexes work and how helpful they are to query data, increasing performance. Also, I taught him how to create a Python script using SQLAlchemy to manage the database. He knew he was familiar with Python, but he never worked using databases. 
##### Why do you think it went so well?
I think this experience went really well because I took my time to teach the things that were new for him. I made him try by himself everything I was explaining. I felt he understood everything because he was able to respond to some questions I asked him. I constantly asked him questions to see if he was following and make sure he was not lost. After my explanation, he was able to work on his assigned project, and he did a pretty good job.
